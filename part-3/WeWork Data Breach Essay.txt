The WeWork Network Vulnerabilities

In 2010, WeWork opened in Manhattan for everyone. They had an environment that was collaborative. It offered many features from printers to meeting spaces.
However, they didn't plan well, and it led to data breaches for over 200 companies and 658 unique and separate devices. The motivations for these breaches and attacks
was due to the importance of who what using this product. Freelancers and Fortune 500 companies were among the clients of WeWork. Although their super fast internet speed was 
something that they were proud of, the problem lied in the fact that everyone worked off of the same WiFi. VLANs or VPNs were either reserved for high-paying clients or not 
offered at all. Because there were no data safety precautions that took place, there was free range to all of the users data in their system. This was a huge problem for the 
security of their users and clients. A well-built network will have firewalls in place, data encryption, and utilize VLANs to partition your network by device type. I can't
find any information what they did to fix the data breach issues, but from what I see on their company website, they have many respected clients that still use their product.
